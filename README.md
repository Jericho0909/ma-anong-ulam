## Ma Anong Ulam:

Ma Anong Ulam is a web-based application built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

Ma Anong Ulam is a website designed to help users discover what meals they can cook, inspired by the common question: “Ma, Anong Ulam?”

The website acts as a food search engine, allowing users to search for dishes:

By dish name (e.g., Adobong Manok)

By main ingredient they have at home (e.g., chicken, fish, vegetables)

By ingredients they already have, so they can find recipes they can cook immediately

## Features:
- Search by Dish Name – Users can type the name of a dish and get relevant results.
- Search by Main Ingredient – Users can type the main ingredient they have (e.g., chicken, fish, vegetables) to find dishes they can cook.
- Ingredient-based Search – Users can input multiple ingredients they have at home to see dishes they can make with what’s available.
- Suggestion Container – Displays filtered suggestions as the user types, with a message when no results are found.
- State Persistence – The last search and results are saved even when navigating back or refreshing the page.
- Responsive Design – Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- User-friendly Interface – Clean layout, clear input placeholders, and easy-to-read results.
- Clear Search Option – Users can reset the search to return to the default dish list.
